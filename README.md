# Pricing & Risk Modelling of Car Insurance Claims Using Poisson GLM

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment developed a Poisson GLM to predict claim frequency for a car insurance portfolio. Used feature vector (car weight, distance, driver age, car age, gender) and exposure to model λ(x) with linear/quadratic/mixed terms, tree methods, boosting, and logistic regression for high claims.

## Key Tasks
- EDA and Poisson GLM with variable selection  
- Poisson regression tree and boosting (with/without base model)  
- 10-fold CV model comparison  
- Logistic regression for high claims (N ≥ 2)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Poisson GLM and generalized linear modelling for pricing  
- Tree-based methods and boosting for risk prediction  
- Cross-validation and model selection  
- Commercial application to insurance pricing and risk assessment
